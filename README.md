## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer (Malignant or Benign) using machine learning models. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of various models to evaluate their performance.

---

## Dataset
The dataset, `BreastCancer.csv`, includes features extracted from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The key features include:
- Mean radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area, and more...

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and dropping irrelevant columns.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating summary statistics and visualizing correlations.
3. **Encoding**: Label encoding the target variable (`diagnosis`).
4. **Outlier Handling**: Clipping outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR).
5. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
6. **Modeling**: Training multiple classification models and evaluating their performance.

---

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

---

## Evaluation
The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

The **XGBoost Classifier** achieved the best performance with an F1 score of **0.977764**.

---

## Installation
